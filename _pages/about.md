I come from Iran and I did my bachelor in Electrical Eng. at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Afterwards, I moved to Germany to pursue my master studies at RWTH Aachen in Electrical Eng. and Information Technology. Currently, I am working as a PhD student at TU Kaiserslautern. My research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
