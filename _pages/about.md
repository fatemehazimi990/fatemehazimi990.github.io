I come from a small town in Iran, called Bardaskan. I did my bachelor's in Electrical Eng. at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Afterward, I moved to Germany to pursue my master studies at RWTH Aachen in Electrical Eng. and Information Technology. Currently, I am working as a Ph.D. student at TU Kaiserslautern. My research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
